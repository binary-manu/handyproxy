# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

For versions that have a major of 0, a convention is followed so that
the minor number is incremented when backward-incompatible changes are
made, while the third number is incremented for backward compatible
changes. For example, versions `0.2.x` are not compatible with `0.1.x`.
